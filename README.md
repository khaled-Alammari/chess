I've tried to build this application before, but unfortunately I faild, This time I learn OOP and it helped me a lot!, beside I started to use functions instead of putting everything in one place, that makes the code easier to read, I guess the useful thing that I should'v done is writing comments, I'am trying to improve myself in this point.
