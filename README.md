I've tried to build this application before, but unfortunately I faild.<br/>
This time I learned OOP and it helped me a lot!, beside I started to use functions instead of putting everything in one place, that made the code easier to read.<br/>
I guess the useful thing that I should'v done is writing comments, I'am trying to improve myself in this point.
